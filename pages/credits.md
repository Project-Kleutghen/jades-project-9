The Qing Emperor's Hindustan Jades is led by [Dr. Kristina Kleutghen](https://kristinakleutghen.com), Director of Undergraduate Studies, Art History and Archaeology at Washington University in St. Louis. The project website is built by Project Coordinator and Research Assistant, Sarah Rider (WU '23), [Sarah Swanz](https://library.wustl.edu/directory/sarah-swanz/), and [Douglas Knox](https://hdw.wustl.edu/people/douglas-knox-0) using Wax - a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) project led and maintained by [Marii Nyrop](https://marii.info/) and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex).

Wax uses open source libraries and frameworks including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), and [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/) and builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and others.
